# ATC-Board
ATC Dashboard, airplane data keeper

We've done this program in order to have an efficient data-keeping platform for ATC.

It has a french / english phraseology repertory (for now)

To execute it, you will need python 3, the main language of the repository.
Ideally, we also recommand that you install Git in order to be able to pull once a week using a crontab.

Ultimately, this program should be able to handle heavy loads of traffic efficiently while giving correct phraseology for any part of the world.
As of now, it supports only the proper canadian phraseology and a couple airlines are still missing. 

In order to be able to use the program, you will need BeautifulSoup4, wich is available here:
